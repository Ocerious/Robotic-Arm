# Robotics Innovation Showcase
<b>What if we could make a smaller version of the same industrial robots companies like Amazon and Tesla use in their factories?</b>
</br></br>
This project is an attempt to accomplish that goal. A hand gesture controlled Arduino robot arm that can be programmed and controlled.

## Description
I built a robotic glove that uses your hand motions to control a six-axis robot. The robotic arm can be opened, closed, or rotated by mirroring simple movements like pinching or rotating your wrist. Essentially just using your hand to guide a robotic arm.
- 6 axis (DoF)
- Portable
- Arduino programmed
- Control the robot with human gestures
- Can be pre-programmed to carry out basic functions
- Can be controlled wirelessly from a range
- Can hold a load weight 600g (Max Load 1kg)
